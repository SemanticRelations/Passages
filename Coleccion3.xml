                <paragraphText>Hotels were among the earliest facilities that bound the United States together. They
                    were both creatures and creators of communities, as well as symptoms of the frenetic
                    quest for community. Even in the first part of the nineteenth century, Americans were
                    already forming the habit of gathering from all corners of the nation for both public and
                    private, business and pleasure purposes. Conventions were the new occasions, and
                    hotels were distinctively American facilities making conventions possible. The first
                    national convention of a major party to choose a candidate for President (that of the
                    National Republican party, which met on December 12, 1831, and nominated Henry
                    Clay for President) was held in Baltimore, at a hotel that was then reputed to be the
                    best in the country. The presence in Baltimore of Barnum's City Hotel, a six-story
                    building with two hundred apartments, helps explain why many other early national
                    political conventions were held there.

                <paragraphText> In the longer run, too. American hotels made other national conventions not only
                    possible but pleasant and convivial. The growing custom of regularly assembling from
                    afar the representatives of all kinds of groups - not only for political conventions, but
                    also for commercial, professional, learned, and avocational ones - in turn supported
                    the multiplying hotels. By mid-twentieth century, conventions accounted for over a
                    third of the yearly room occupancy of all hotels in the nation, about eighteen thousand
                    different conventions were held annually with a total attendance of about ten million
                    persons.

                <paragraphText>  Nineteenth-century American hotelkeepers, who were no longer the genial,
                    deferential "hosts" of the eighteenth-century European inn, became leading citizens.
                    Holding a large stake in the community, they exercised power to make it prosper. As
                    owners or managers of the local "palace of the public", they were makers and shapers
                    of a principal community attraction. Travelers from abroad were mildly shocked by
                    this high social position.

                <paragraphText>          Beads were probably the first durable ornaments humans possessed, and the
                    intimate relationship they had with their owners is reflected in the fact that beads are
                    among the most common items found in ancient archaeological sites. In the past, as
                    today, men, women, and children adorned themselves with beads. In some cultures
                    still, certain beads are often worn from birth until death, and then are buried with their
                    owners for the afterlife. Abrasion due to daily wear alters the surface features of beads,
                    and if they are buried for long, the effects of corrosion can further change their
                    appearance. Thus, interest is imparted to the bead both by use and the effects of time.

                <paragraphText>          Beads are miniature bundles of secrets waiting to be revealed: their history,
                    manufacture, cultural context, economic role, and ornamental use are all points of
                    information one hopes to unravel. Even the most mundane beads may have traveled
                    great distances and been exposed to many human experiences. The bead researcher
                    must gather information from many diverse fields. In addition to having to be a
                    generalist while specializing in what may seem to be a narrow field, the researcher is
                    faced with the problem of primary materials that have little or no documentation. Many
                    ancient beads that are of ethnographic interest have often been separated from their
                    original cultural context.

            <paragraphText>          In the world of birds, bill design is a prime example of evolutionary fine-tuning.
                Shorebirds such as oystercatchers use their bills to pry open the tightly sealed shells of
                their prey; hummingbirds have stiletto-like bills to probe the deepest nectar-bearing
            flowers; and kiwis smell out earthworms thanks to nostrils located at the tip of their
                beaks. But few birds are more intimately tied to their source of sustenance than are
                crossbills. Two species of these finches, named for the way the upper and lower parts
                of their bills cross, rather than meet in the middle, reside in the evergreen forests of
                North America and feed on the seeds held within the cones of coniferous trees.

        <paragraphText> The efficiency of the bill is evident when a crossbill locates a cone. Using a lateral
            motion of its lower mandible, the bird separates two overlapping scales on the cone and
            exposes the seed. The crossed mandibles enable the bird to exert a powerful biting
            force at the bill tips, which is critical for maneuvering them between the scales and
            spreading the scales apart. Next, the crossbill snakes its long tongue into the gap and
            draws out the seed. Using the combined action of the bill and tongue, the bird cracks
             open and discards the woody seed covering action and swallows the nutritious inner kernel.
            This whole process takes but a few seconds and is repeated hundreds of times a day.

                The bills of different crossbill species and subspecies vary - some are stout and
                deep, others more slender and shallow. As a rule, large-billed crossbills are better at
                seeming seeds from large cones, while small-billed crossbills are more deft at
                removing the seeds from small, thin-scaled cones. Moreover, the degree to which cones
                are naturally slightly open or tightly closed helps determine which bill design is the best.

        One anomaly is the subspecies of red crossbill known as the Newfoundland
        crossbill. This bird has a large, robust bill, yet most of Newfoundland's conifers
        have small cones, the same kind of cones that the slender-billed white-wings rely on.

                beyond the flourished signature of John Hancock and the other 55 men who signed it,
                you will also find the name of one woman, Mary Katherine Goddard. It was she, a
                Baltimore printer, who published the first official copies of the Declaration, the first
                copies that included the names of its signers and therefore heralded the support of all
                thirteen colonies.

                opened a printing shop in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1762. When he proceeded to
                get into trouble with his partners and creditors, it was Mary Goddard and her mother
                 who were left to run the shop. In 1765 they began publishing the Providence Gazette, a
                weekly newspaper. Similar problems seemed to follow her brother as he opened
                businesses in Philadelphia and again in Baltimore. Each time Ms. Goddard was
                brought in to run the newspapers. After starting Baltimore's first newspaper, The
                Maryland Journal, in 1773, her brother went broke trying to organize a colonial postal
                service. While he was in debtor's prison. Mary Katherine Goddard's name appeared on
                the newspaper's masthead for the first time.

            <paragraphText>   When the Continental Congress fled there from Philadelphia in 1776, it
                commissioned Ms. Goddard to print the first official version of the Declaration of
                Independence in January 1777. After printing the documents, she herself paid the post
                riders to deliver the Declaration throughout the colonies.

    <paragraphText>    During the American Revolution, Mary Goddard continued to publish Baltimore's
        only newspaper, which one historian claimed was "second to none among the
        colonies". She was also the city's postmaster from 1775 to 1789 - appointed by
        Benjamin Franklin - and is considered to be the first woman to hold a federal position.

            <paragraphText>          There are three main types of galaxy: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. The Milky
                Way is a spiral galaxy, a flattish disc of stars with two spiral arms emerging from its
                central nucleus. About one-quarter of all galaxies have this shape. Spiral galaxies are
                well supplied with the interstellar gas in which new stars form: as the rotating spiral
                pattern sweeps around the galaxy it compresses gas and dust, triggering the formation
                of bright young stars and in its arms. The elliptical galaxies have a symmetrical elliptical or
                spheroidal shape with no obvious structure. Most of their member stars are very old
                and since ellipticals are devoid of interstellar gas, no new stars are forming in them.
                The biggest and brightest galaxies in the universe are ellipticals with masses of about
                1013 times that of the Sun, these giants may frequently be sources of strong radio
                emission, in which case they are called radio galaxies. About two-thirds of all galaxies
                are elliptical. Irregular galaxies comprise about one-tenth of all galaxies and they come
                in many subclasses.

            <paragraphText>         Measurement in space is quite different from measurement on Earth. Some
                terrestrial distances can be expressed as intervals of time, the time to fly from one
                continent to another or the time it takes to drive to work, for example. By comparison
                with these familiar yardsticks, the distances to the galaxies are incomprehensibly large,
                but they too are made more manageable by using a time calibration, in this case the
                distance that light travels in one year. On such a scale the nearest giant spiral galaxy,
                the Andromeda galaxy, is two million light years away. The most distant luminous
                objects seen by telescopes are probably ten thousand million light years away. Their
                light was already halfway here before the Earth even formed. The light from the nearby
                Virgo galaxy set out when reptiles still dominated the animal world.

            <paragraphText>         Before the mid-1860's, the impact of the railroads in the United States was limited,
                in the sense that the tracks ended at the Missouri River, approximately the centers of the
                country. At that point the trains turned their freight, mail, and passengers over to
                steamboats, wagons, and stagecoaches. This meant that wagon freighting, stagecoaching
                and steamboating did not come to an end when the first train appeared; rather they
                became supplements or feeders. Each new "end-of-track" became a center for animaldrawn
                or waterborne transportation. The major effect of the railroad was to shorten the
                distance that had to be covered by the older, slower, and more costly means. Wagon
                freighters continued operating throughout the 1870's and 1880's and into the 1890's,
                although over constantly shrinking routes, and coaches and wagons continued to
                crisscross the West wherever the rails had not yet been laid.

            <paragraphText> The beginning of a major change was foreshadowed in the later 1860's, when the
                Union Pacific Railroad at last began to build westward from the Central Plaints city of
                Omaha to meet the Central Pacific Railroad advancing eastward form California through
                the formidable barriers of the Sierra Nevada. Although President Abraham Lincoln
                signed the original Pacific Railroad bill in 1862 and a revised, financially much more
                generous version in 1864, little construction was completed until 1865 on the Central
                Pacific and 1866 on the Union Pacific. The primary reason was skepticism that a
                railroad built through so challenging and thinly settled a stretch of desert, mountain,
                and semiarid plain could pay a profit. In the words of an economist, this was a case of
                "premature enterprise", where not only the cost of construction but also the very high
                risk deterred private investment. In discussing the Pacific Railroad bill, the chair of the
                congressional committee bluntly stated that without government subsidy no one would
                undertake so unpromising a venture; yet it was a national necessity to link East and
                West together.

            <paragraphText>          Humanity's primal efforts to systematize the concepts of size, shapes, and number
                are usually regarded as the earliest mathematics. However, the concept of number and
                the counting process developed so long before the time of recorded history (there is
                archaeological evidence that counting was employed by humans as far back as 50,000
                years ago) that the manner of this development is largely conjectural. Imaging how it
                probably came about is not difficult. The argument that humans, even in prehistoric
                times, had some number sense, at least to the extent of recognizing the concepts of
                more and less when some objects were added to or taken away from a small group,
                seems fair, for studies have shown that some animal possess such a sense.

            <paragraphText>  With the gradual evolution of society, simple counting became imperative. A tribe
                had to know how many members it had and how many enemies, and shepherd needed
                to know if the flock of sheep was decreasing in size. Probably the earliest way of keeping
                a count was by some simple tally method, employing the principle of one-to-one
                correspondence. In keeping a count of sheep, for example, one finger per sheep could
                be turned under. Counts could also be maintained by making scratches in the dirt or on
                a stone, by cutting notches in a piece of wood, or by tying knots in a string.

                Then, perhaps later, an assortment of vocal sounds was developed as a word tally
                against the number of objects in a small group. And still later, with the refinement of
                writing, a set of signs was devised to stand for these numbers. Such an imagined
                development is supported by reports of anthropologists in their studies of present-day
                societies that are thought to be similar to those of early humans.

            <paragraphText>          As the merchant class expanded in the eighteenth-century North American colonies,
                the silversmith and the coppersmith businesses rose to serve it. Only a few silversmiths
                were available in New York or Boston in the late seventeenth century, but in the
                eighteenth century they could be found in all major colonial cities. No other colonial
                 artisans rivaled the silversmiths' prestige. They handled the most expensive materials
                and possessed direct connections to prosperous colonies merchants. Their products,
                primarily silver plates and bowls, reflected their exalted status and testified to their
                customers' prominence.

            <paragraphText> Silver stood as one of the surest ways to store wealth at a time before neighborhood
                banks existed. Unlike the silver coins from which they were made, silver articles were
                readily identifiable. Often formed to individual specifications, they always carried the
                silversmith's distinctive markings and consequently could be traced and retrieved.
                Customers generally secured the silver for the silver objects they ordered. They
                saved coins, took them to smiths, and discussed the type of pieces they desired.
                Silversmiths complied with these requests by melting the money in a small furnace,
                adding a bit of copper to form a stronger alloy, and casting the alloy in rectangular
                blocks. They hammered these ingots to the appropriate thickness by hand, shaped
                them, and pressed designs into them for adornment. Engraving was also done by hand.
                In addition to plates and bowls, some customers sought more intricate products, such as
                silver teapots. These were made by shaping or casting parts separately and then
                soldering them together.

            <paragraphText> Colonial coppersmithing also came of age in the early eighteenth century and
                prospered in northern cities. Copper's ability to conduct heat efficiently and to resist
                corrosion contributed to its attractiveness. But because it was expensive in colonial
                America, coppersmiths were never very numerous. Virtually all copper worked by
                smiths was imported as sheets or obtained by recycling old copper goods. Copper was
                used for practical items, but it was not admired for its beauty. Coppersmiths employed
                it to fashion pots and kettles for the home. They shaped it in much the same manner as
                silver or melted it in a foundry with lead or tin. They also mixed it with zinc to make
                brass for maritime and scientific instruments.
